KeyPuncher if for thouse who work with vsphere web console and are sick of not having something that copy pastes into the screen
there is only support for DK and ENG keyboard (can change if somebody really wants it)
use CTRL+ALT+G or CTRL+ALT+V or CTRL+ALT+L to copy the text you have in copy paste bag
